# Task Completion Checklist
- Ensure relevant phase workflow docs in `docs/plan` and `TODO.md`/`DEVLOG.md` are updated.
- Run `cargo fmt` + `cargo clippy` + `cargo test` (or targeted scripts) when applicable.
- Re-run perf benchmarks if performance-related changes were made and record results in docs.
- Note progress in `DEVLOG.md` with timestamped entry.
