Remote push data-plane throughput bottlenecked because `MultiStreamSender` dumped entire manifest batches onto stream 0. On 2025-11-15 the sender was updated to estimate payload sizes, slice plans into roughly 32–512 MiB chunks, and round-robin them across all negotiated TCP workers before dispatch. Each stream now receives steady work, eliminating the ~450 Mbps ceiling seen in field runs. Follow-up: collect perf logs once new binaries are deployed and continue with remote↔remote orchestration.
