Updated TransferFacade small-file heuristics: tar shards now trigger at ~8 MiB or ≈1k sub-1 MiB files with automatic small-profile detection (≤64 KiB average). Remaining small batches stay raw only for <32 files. transfer_plan mirrors thresholds, and new unit tests cover shard/RAW cases. Windows bench script patched to drop PowerShell 7 `??` operator. `cargo test -p blit-core transfer_facade` passes.
