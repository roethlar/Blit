Created REMOTE_TRANSFER_PARITY.md outlining the steps to unify push/pull transports: extract shared payload/progress/data-plane modules, extend PullChunk with negotiation/summary, rebuild daemon pull onto the hybrid transport, rewrite CLI RemotePullClient to use the new path + progress, and add integration/perf tests for parity. TODO.md now carries a P0 checklist mirroring those tasks.
