Remote transfer parity P0 tracks shared remote::transfer modules, proto negotiation, daemon/client rewrites, and parity tests. Shared modules plus CLI/daemon pull changes are complete, and auto-tuning now feeds chunk sizing + payload prefetch/concurrency across push and pull so hybrid transport adapts automatically. Next focus: validation/perf tests (TCP and forced gRPC) and documenting the results.
