Remote transfer parity P0 tracks shared remote::transfer modules, proto negotiation, daemon/client rewrites, and parity tests. Shared modules plus CLI/daemon pull changes are complete, auto-tuning now feeds chunk sizing + payload prefetch hints, and the daemon need-list flush plus client permission filtering keep the TCP data plane active with sub-second first-payload latency. Remaining work: implement multiplexed TCP data-plane streams driven by auto-tuned worker counts and add parity/perf tests proving 10 GbE throughput.
