Remote transfer parity refactor is captured in docs/plan/REMOTE_TRANSFER_PARITY.md and tracked as a P0 in TODO.md. Plan includes: shared remote::transfer modules + auto-tune wiring, PullChunk proto negotiation/summary, daemon pull rewrite on hybrid transport with larger TCP buffers/zero-copy, CLI RemotePullClient rewrite with progress, and parity tests/benchmarks. Next immediate step is implementing the shared modules and feeding auto_tune::determine_tuning into SchedulerOptions so both push/pull ramp correctly.
