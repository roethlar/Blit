Remote mirror pushes now invoke daemon-side purge helpers: `handle_push_stream` records manifest paths, computes extraneous entries, and deletes them after transfer (summary includes `entries_deleted`). `PushSummary`/CLI output report deletion counts, fallback path unified. Added async purge helpers + tests (`purge_extraneous_entries_removes_unexpected_paths`). Docs/TODO/DEVLOG updated accordingly (2025-10-23). Tests run: cargo build -p blit-core; cargo check; cargo test -p blit-daemon; cargo test -p blit-cli; cargo test -p blit-utils.
