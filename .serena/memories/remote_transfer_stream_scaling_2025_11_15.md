Remote push/pull auto-tuning now scales TCP data-plane streams much more aggressively. `determine_remote_tuning` picks initial/max streams based on size hints (up to 12/16), and the daemon heuristics for push + pull negotiate up to 16 sockets for multi-GiB manifests (previous cap was 6–8). This should push aggregate throughput well beyond the prior ~1.2 Gbps cap while we work on per-file sharding. Update docs/devlog mention the new thresholds.
