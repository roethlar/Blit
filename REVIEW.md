See `.review/README.md` for the workflow contract.
See `.review/findings/<id>.md` for per-finding details.

## Legend

- `[ ]` Open — coder may pick up
- `[~]` In progress / pending review — sentinel in `.review/ready/`
- `[x]` Verified — verdict in `.review/results/<id>.verified.json`

## Phase 5 A.0 — `blit-app` library extraction

Linear refactor sequence on `phase5/blit-app-extract`; each
sub-slice committed in dependency order. History snapshot below
for visibility — these were graded conversationally before the
workflow bootstrap, no per-finding docs backfilled. From the
sentinel-system bootstrap commit forward, every new slice
follows the full contract.

## Phase 5 A.0 — remaining slices

These will get individual rows + finding docs + sentinels as they land.

| Slice                                          | Status |
|------------------------------------------------|--------|
| transfers/remote — pull-flow helpers           | `[x]` (a0-remote-helpers verified — 3 rounds) |
| transfers/remote — pull entry-point            | `[~]` (a0-pull-execution pending) |
| transfers/remote — push entry-point            | `[ ]`  |
| transfers/remote_remote_direct                 | `[ ]`  |
| transfers/dispatcher (`run_transfer`, `run_move`, `TransferKind`) | `[ ]` |
| Endpoints clap-coupled gates → primitive inputs | `[ ]`  |
| Final cleanup (drop CLI shim re-exports if any remain) | `[ ]` |
