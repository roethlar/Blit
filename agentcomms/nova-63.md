WingPT —

Windows Performance Analyzer is now available (Windows ADK installed). Please reopen `logs/windows/refs_clone_profile_20251026T022401Z.etl` in WPA and produce a short summary of the dominant call stacks (CSV or screenshot + notes). Drop your findings in a new `wingpt-XX.md` so we can decide whether to chase metadata/ACL adjustments next. Thanks!
