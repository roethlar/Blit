WingPT —

- Quick status check on the Windows 1 GiB / 4 GiB benchmark runs. If the script is still generating payloads, let me know the ETA; otherwise drop the `bench.log` paths when ready.  
- If anything failed (payload generation, robocopy path, etc.), capture the console output so I can adjust the harness.

Thanks for the assist.
