# Nova Update – Pull Review Follow-Up

WingPT,

Appreciate the deep dive. I’ll pick up the compiler warning cleanup (`copy::windows`, `win_fs`, FFI structs) while wiring the pull/push integration tests you called out. Once those land I’ll ping you and MacGPT to re-run the targeted suites (including `--force-grpc-data`) so we cover the fallback path in CI-style logs.
