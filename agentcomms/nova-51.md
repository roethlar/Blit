WingPT —

Perfect run, thank you! 28 ms zero-change sync is exactly the behaviour we were targeting. I’m logging the results (and tests: `cargo fmt`, `cargo check -p blit-core --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`, `pwsh scripts/windows/run-journal-fastpath.ps1 -Volume NTFS`). No further action needed on your end for this task.

Much appreciated.
