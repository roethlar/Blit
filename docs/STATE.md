# STATE — single entry point for "what is true right now"

Last updated: 2026-07-14 (49th session)

- **NEXT ACTION — adjudicate the ROUND-7 review of the Mac↔Mac instrument (Queue 1(ii)), then the run.** The instrument is at `1e03063` (prereg **rev 7**); the round-7 review (codex + grok) was launched at the end of the 49th session — **read `.review/results/macmac-harness-r7.{codex,grok}.md` first**. The harness **REFUSES a timed run** (`exit 2` without `CLEARED_BY_REVIEW=1`) and **NOT ONE DATUM HAS EVER BEEN TAKEN.** **⚠ TO RUN IT THE OWNER MUST CLOSE THEIR CODEX SESSIONS** — nagatha is a bench **END**; the quiescence gate refuses while `codex`/`cargo`/`rustc` runs on **either** Mac (it fires correctly today, and load on nagatha is what trips it). Time Machine OFF on both. Rig: nagatha `10.1.10.92` ↔ `q` `10.1.10.54`, 10GbE/9000, build pinned `f35702a`. **Then `pf-1`** (the HARD GATE), which two pf-0 results BIND: between-session grading is dead (a 20% recovery = 46 ms sits under the 78 ms floor), so pf-1 must **measure its own paired within-session floor** before grading; and the fast arm is **BISTABLE** — grade the distribution, not the median.
- **THE INSTRUMENT IS THE RISK — 69 findings across SIX reviews of this one harness, 69 accepted, 0 rejected, and it has still never run.** Three project claims were already retracted to harness bugs. **TWO DEFECT CLASSES have recurred in every single round**, and the next review must assume they are still present:
  - **"Fixed the branch I was shown, not the class."** The *same* materiality bug escaped **four** rounds running, each time through a branch the last fix had not covered (measurand → control-PARTIAL → control-UNDERPOWERED → the marginal bar substituting for paired magnitude, which reported `REPRODUCES` off a **1 ms** effect). A fail-open `pgrep` was fixed in one gate and left identical in a duplicate. **Rev 7's answer is structural**: the 1.10 bar now takes **no part in inference at all** (it is the acceptance criterion, reported only); direction = the sign test, magnitude = the paired CI, equivalence = the CI vs the margin; and the controls are a **precondition** — unless every control certifies below **half** the material effect, **no verdict is read, neither a null nor a reproduction**.
  - **"A fix that never executed."** `SETTLE_MS` — the equal pre-fsync window introduced to neutralise a free-writeback artifact **capable of manufacturing a one-directional P1 out of nothing** — **HAD NEVER RUN, in any revision**: an `awk` inside a command substitution had the wrong quoting, so `sleep` failed every time and its exit status was discarded. The prereg asserted that fix for **three revisions** while it was dead. It is now performed and **measured inside the same process as the fsync walk** (`settled_ms`, a CSV column), and a pair that did not settle **VOIDS**.
  Standing rules, all earned: **verify the instrument before believing the measurement**; **`bash -n` is not an execution** (`SELFTEST=1` runs the gates for real and exits non-zero if any is **blind**); **read the existing harnesses first** (zoey already documented the cross-process `monotonic()` trap I re-introduced); and **a protection that cannot be observed is not a protection.**
- **⚠ THE MAC↔MAC RIG IS *NOT* AN H1 DISCRIMINATOR — retracted 2026-07-14.** "Reproduces ⇒ H1 dies" was **WRONG**: H1 accuses **blit's own code paths**, not Windows, and that code runs on macOS too — so a reproduction is *consistent with* H1. It answers one thing, scoped to this pair: **can P1 occur WITHOUT a Windows peer?** A reproduction ⇒ P1 is not waivable as "Windows residue" (it does **not** prove a platform-*general* cost, and leaves macOS/APFS and host×role open). A null ⇒ it did not reproduce *on this pair* — consistent with "Windows required", **not proof** of it, and reportable only if the run could have SEEN the effect. Detail: the pre-registration.
- **BASELINE RE-RECORD (D-2026-07-14-1, owner 2026-07-14) — a prerequisite slice for `pf-final`, NOT for pf-1.** Both committed ceilings were recorded at **MTU 1500** before the fabric went jumbo, and pf-0 showed jumbo makes both arms 3–4% faster — so a jumbo build graded against them is **LENIENT** and could let a regression pass. Each rig's baseline is **re-recorded once with its ORIGINAL old build at MTU 9000**, then re-frozen (rig W `bench_otp12_win.sh:105`; rig Z `bench_otp12_zoey.sh:102`; rig D unaffected). Constraints — same old build per rig, `BASELINE_SUMMARY` stays override-free, pf-0's start-AND-end MSS gate applies — in **D-2026-07-14-1**.
- **pf-0 DONE — MTU is KILLED as a material cause of P1 (2026-07-14, `docs/bench/otp12-jumbo-win-2026-07-13/`).** A-B-B-A on `q` (9000/1500/1500/9000), **256 timed runs, 0 voided**, MSS gate held start AND end of every session. `Δ_9000 = 236`, `Δ_1500 = 229`, measured noise floor **N_Δ = 78 ms**, **r = −3.1% → KILLED**. The null is **not vacuous** — `wm_tcp_large` ran 3–4% faster at jumbo on **both** arms, so the manipulation reached the wire; the benefit is **symmetric**, which is why it cannot explain an **asymmetry**. codex NOT READY → **7/7 accepted** (`11f0c2a`): every finding was a *claim* outrunning the *data* (it recomputed and confirmed all the numbers). **Two limits that now bind pf-1**: (a) the run is **NOT powered** to exclude a *contributing*-size effect (20% of Δ = 46 ms < the 78 ms floor) — it excludes a DOMINANT one only; (b) 78 ms is **between**-session noise, so cross-session grading of a counterfactual is dead, and **pf-1 must measure its own paired within-session floor and register a resolution check before grading**.
- **THE FAST ARM IS BISTABLE — the trap named in pf-1's gate above.** `win_init` runs are **bimodal** (~730/~840 ms): S1 drew 6 low/2 high and S4 drew 2 low/6 high **at the same MTU**, and that mode mixture — not MTU — is what sets N_Δ. `mac_init` is stable to 5–6 ms. A counterfactual that merely shifts the mixture would **fake a recovery**.
- **P1 REPRODUCES ON A SECOND MAC (2026-07-13, `docs/bench/otp12-q-baseline-2026-07-13/`).** `wm_tcp_mixed` = **1.385 FAIL** on `q`↔netwatch-01 **at MTU 9000**, while all three controls PASS at **1.002–1.043** in the same session (so rig noise is ~2–4% and P1 is 10× outside it). **P1 is a property of the macOS↔Windows PAIRING, not of one machine** — the assumption **H1** rests on (corrected 2026-07-14: H5/H6/H7 are **P2** hypotheses; the earlier "H1/H5/H6/H7" was wrong), never tested until now. **And jumbo does NOT dissolve P1** — pf-0 has now measured the matched 1500 arm and killed MTU outright (above).
- **THE MAC IS A BENCH END — the codex loop and a rig-W session CANNOT run concurrently** (`.agents/machines.md`). A 53-min A-B-B-A attempt was destroyed by codex load on the Mac and discarded; the contamination is *asymmetric* (it inflates `mac_init` and MANUFACTURES P1). **Rig-W now runs on `q`** (dedicated M4 mini, quiet, faster than nagatha), which decouples the two for good.
- Recent sessions (2026-07-11/13, 44th–46th): **otp-10/otp-11 closed; otp-12c RECORDED (rig D 7/7); the perf plan is ACTIVE (D-2026-07-13-1).** Every transfer rides the ONE session (separate local orchestration gone, −6.2k lines at 11b; the unsound journal fast path died with it). Suite **1488**. SMALL_FILE_CEILING paused (D-2026-07-05-1).
- **P1 (the headline invariance criterion) — the one thing between blit and shipping.** Fails rig W (`wm_tcp_mixed` 1.237 and 1.300 — do NOT read that as a regression, it is **two different Mac NICs**), but **PASSES 8/8 with Linux on both ends** (`docs/bench/otp12-perf-2026-07-13/`; P1's own cell 1.092/1.003). So it is **platform-INTERACTING, not pure layout** — yet **NOT exonerated**: a code path that only bites on one platform (H1's Windows accept branch) looks identical. **P1 HAS NO ESCAPE HATCH** (codex r5 F1): D-2026-07-12-1 waives only a *cross-direction* miss for a cell that ALREADY passes invariance — P1 *is* the invariance failure. So: **fix it to ≤1.10, or the owner amends acceptance criterion 1.** Neither is assumed.
- **⚠ THREE of my claims were reported and RETRACTED on 2026-07-13**, all the same root cause — trusting an instrument I had not validated: (1) "P1 is code" (a harness that keyed durability to the *initiator*, not the destination); (2) "P1 is acceptable platform residue" (D-2026-07-12-1 does not cover it); (3) "macOS can't send jumbo / the switch is broken" (it was `net.inet.raw.maxdgram` capping *ping*; TCP was always fine — it cost the owner a pointless adapter swap). **Verify the instrument before believing the measurement.**

Rules: this file wins over every other doc (AGENTS.md §1). Keep it ≤ 200 lines and
≤ 3 handoff entries — prune into `DEVLOG.md`. Update it via the `handoff`
procedure in `docs/agent/PROTOCOL.md`; never let it describe a past session.

## Now (active work)

- **ONE_TRANSFER_PATH ACTIVE (D-2026-07-05-1 directive,
  D-2026-07-05-4 "flip the plan and go") — otp-4a landed.** The
  invariant (plan doc, verbatim): ONE block of transfer code;
  direction/initiator/verb can NEVER affect wall time by blit's doing
  — impossible by construction because the per-direction drivers and
  `Push`/`PullSync` are deleted at cutover. Slices otp-1..13;
  converge-up per cell (±10%); symmetric-fs disk-to-disk verdict
  cells. **D-2026-07-05-2: same-build peers only, refusal at session
  open.** Progress (each slice through the codex loop; per-slice
  detail lives in DEVLOG + `.review/`, NOT here):
  - **Closed `[x]`: otp-1 … otp-11** — the whole session machine, the
    baselines (otp-2/2w), the **CUTOVER DELETION** (4 drivers +
    `Push`/`PullSync` + 13 messages out of tree AND proto, −13.8k lines,
    no bridge; relay removed D-2026-07-11-1), and **otp-11b's deletion of
    the entire old orchestration** (−6.2k lines: orchestrator, engine,
    local_worker, auto_tune, change_journal — the last an UNSOUND fast
    path that silently lost data). The deletion-proof acceptance line
    COMPLETES. Detail: DEVLOG 2026-07-10/11/12; evidence
    `docs/bench/otp2{,w}-baseline-2026-07-10/`, `otp11-local-2026-07-11/`.
- **SMALL_FILE_CEILING PAUSED at sf-2 (D-2026-07-05-1)** — sf-1/sf-2
  `[x]`; **sf-3a+ blocked** until ONE_TRANSFER_PATH ships, then
  resume/re-derive on the unified baseline. Principle: ceiling-driven,
  never competitor-relative (D-2026-07-04-4 — do not re-litigate).
- **Background**: REV4 code-complete, gates DATA-COMPLETE (declarations
  in Blocked); the codex loop governs all changes (D-2026-07-04-1).

## Queue (ordered)

1. **`docs/plan/ONE_TRANSFER_PATH.md` (ACTIVE, D-2026-07-05-4) —
   the only work item until it ships**: slices otp-1..13 through the
   codex loop per slice (owner re-affirmed). otp-1, otp-3, otp-4a,
   otp-4b (1/2/3), otp-5a, otp-5b (1/2), otp-6 (a/b), otp-7 (a, b-1,
   b-2), otp-8, otp-9 (a/b), otp-2 (+ otp-2w), otp-10 (a, b-1/2,
   c-1/2), **otp-11 (a + b)**, **otp-12a (zoey)**, **otp-12b
   (Mac↔Windows)** `[x]`. 12a: 10 PASS, 2 to the walk. 12b — THE
   INVARIANCE CRITERION: 11/12 PASS (1.003–1.057); wm_tcp_mixed 1.237
   (TCP×mixed×dest-initiator, code-shaped); push_tcp_small 1.149
   (both rigs); Win→Mac beats the better old direction 6/6; Mac→Win
   gap shapes recorded for the walk
   (`docs/bench/otp12-{zoey,win}-2026-07-12/`). **otp-12c `[x]`
   RECORDED 2026-07-13**: direct-path baseline at the cutover sha
   (`docs/bench/otp12c-win-2026-07-13/`) + the delegated rig-D
   matrix (`docs/bench/otp12c-delegated-2026-07-13/`, 5/7 PASS at
   RUNS=4; both FAIL cells PASS at RUNS=8 — see Blocked; rig D 7/7).
   **otp-12d and otp-13 are DEFERRED, not next** — otp-12c's rows are
   PRE-FIX, and `docs/plan/OTP12_PERF_FINDINGS.md` (pf-final) voids
   pre-fix new arms for acceptance. Assembling the acceptance matrix now
   would build otp-13's artifact from void rows.
1a. **`docs/plan/OTP12_PERF_FINDINGS.md` — THE REAL NEXT ITEM**
   (**ACTIVE**, D-2026-07-13-1 — owner: "just write the code and
   reviewloop slice by slice"; implementation proceeds, each slice
   through the codex loop).
   Two experiments come BEFORE any code; both docs own their detail.
   **(i) The A-B-B-A MTU run on `q` — `[x]` DONE 2026-07-14: MTU KILLED**
   (`r = −3.1%`; `docs/bench/otp12-jumbo-win-2026-07-13/`). See the pf-0
   bullet at the top for the two limits it puts on pf-1.
   **(ii) THE MAC↔MAC RIG — the missing cell of the 2×2** (owner,
   2026-07-13). Linux↔Linux = **no P1** (8/8 PASS); macOS↔Windows = **P1**
   (1.237/1.300/1.385/1.362); macOS↔macOS = **?** Design, decision rule and
   the retraction of the "H1 dies" framing: **see NEXT ACTION at the top**
   and the rev-2 pre-registration. **Both Macs are bench ENDS: the codex
   loop CANNOT run during the session** (the gate enforces it).
   **P1 HAS NO ESCAPE HATCH** (codex r5 F1): D-2026-07-12-1 waives only a
   *cross-direction* miss for a cell that ALREADY passes invariance — P1
   *is* the invariance failure. **Fix it to ≤1.10, or the owner amends
   acceptance criterion 1.** Not assumed either way. P2
   (`push_tcp_small` 1.105–1.201) is a converge bar vs the OLD build,
   UNTESTED on the Linux rig. Sequence: **MTU run + Mac↔Mac → pf-1 → fix
   → pf-final (ALL rigs) → otp-12d → otp-13.**
1b. **AFTER otp-12 — the Windows/local pair, planned TOGETHER** (same tar
   path, opposite directions: a fidelity fix ADDS per-file work to a path
   already losing to robocopy, so planning them apart optimises one against
   the other). Both docs own their detail; do not restate it here.
   - **`docs/bugs/windows-attrs-and-ads-lost-on-tar-path.md` (D-2026-07-13-3)**
     — Windows attributes + ADS silently dropped, exit 0, **both routes
     (measured)**; loss is **conditional on file count**
     (`transfer_plan.rs:103-109`). Unlanded Windows support, NOT a regression.
     **Fix = WIRE CONTRACT change** → amend `TRANSFER_SESSION.md` first.
   - **`docs/plan/LOCAL_SMALL_FILE_PATH.md` (Draft, D-2026-07-13-2)** — local
     apply **does not scale** (8 workers buy 1.05×; robocopy gets ~2.2× from 8
     threads) and ships **one** worker. At EQUAL concurrency blit BEATS
     robocopy; at 8-vs-8 it loses 1.9×. `docs/bench/win-local-ab-2026-07-13/`.
2. **10 GbE owner declarations (still pending)**: ue-1, ue-2, REV4 →
   Shipped (zero-copy resolved — D-2026-07-05-3). Follow-ups largely
   absorbed by otp-2/otp-12's rig matrices.
3. **PAUSED: `docs/plan/SMALL_FILE_CEILING.md`** (D-2026-07-05-1) —
   resumes/re-derives after ONE_TRANSFER_PATH ships.
4. **PAUSED: design-review queue** (`REVIEW.md`; w7-1 topmost open row —
   likely landed inside otp-6's one-delete-rule slice; re-check first).
5. **Zero-copy receive — UNPARKED (D-2026-07-05-3)**: gate met (UNAS 8
   Pro daemon CPU-bound below 10 GbE from SSD cache). Executes AFTER
   cutover as a runtime-selected write strategy in the unified receive
   sink (design: eval doc §If-FAST-evidence; dead module deletes in
   w8-1). Rig facts + build recipe: DEVLOG 2026-07-05 10:00.
   **Standing owner safety rule**: ALL activity on rig `zoey` stays
   inside its `…/blit-temp/` folder — nothing written outside it, ever;
   no daemon runs on zoey without a fresh go.
6. **Post-REV4 residue** (unowned, 5 items) — list in DEVLOG 2026-07-13 21:00Z.

## Authoritative docs right now

- **`docs/plan/ONE_TRANSFER_PATH.md` (ACTIVE — governs all work;
  D-2026-07-05-4)**; `docs/plan/OTP7_RESUME.md` (**Active**,
  D-2026-07-09-1 — otp-7 slice design; governs otp-7a/7b).
- Active plans: `docs/plan/SMALL_FILE_CEILING.md` (**paused** at
  sf-2) and **`docs/plan/UNIFIED_TRANSFER_ENGINE_REV4.md`** (code-
  complete; measurement gates remain). REV4 superseded v1/REV2/REV3
  (history only).
- Process: `docs/agent/GPT_REVIEW_LOOP.md` (Active) — the codex loop
  for **all code and plan changes** (D-2026-07-04-1); `.review/README.md`
  is retired as the grading mechanism (its `findings/`/`results/`
  records and the REVIEW.md index remain live).
- Review loop: `REVIEW.md` (all `ue-r2-*` rows `[x]`; design-queue
  rows) + `.review/findings/` + `.review/results/`.
- Other plans: `ZERO_COPY_RECEIVE_EVAL.md` (module delete ratified
  D-2026-06-12-1, executes w8-1; **capability unparked
  D-2026-07-05-3** — post-cutover write strategy), `TUI_REWORK.md`
  (gated on Round 1),
  `BENCHMARK_10GBE_PLAN.md` (Historical; env note lives in the queue).

## Blocked / waiting (all owner declarations; checkpoints are owner-only)

- **Rigs**: owner go standing through otp-12. zoey (12a), netwatch-01
  (12b), netwatch-01↔skippy (12c) done; **magneto↔skippy = the same-OS
  rig** (new 2026-07-13). Rig facts + the macOS ping/MTU trap:
  `.agents/machines.md`.
- **otp-12c RECORDED 2026-07-13** (pre-fix rows = replication/control
  evidence, NOT acceptance evidence; Queue 1a):
  `docs/bench/otp12c-win-2026-07-13/` (198 runs) and
  `otp12c-delegated-2026-07-13/` (**rig D 7/7 PASS**). Codex: FAIL →
  **7/7 accepted**. Detail: DEVLOG 2026-07-13.
- **Three 10 GbE gate declarations**: ue-1, ue-2 (pass/fail or
  re-scope), REV4 → Shipped. (Zero-copy RESOLVED — D-2026-07-05-3.)

## Open questions

- **(OPEN, ripe — data in hand)** REV4 → Shipped flip: awaits the
  three declarations in Blocked (zero-copy resolved, D-2026-07-05-3).
- **(SLOTTED 2026-07-12 — owner ack)** `docs/WHITEPAPER.md` §8 (~line
  592) describes the deleted `determine_remote_tuning` — fix folded
  into **w10-docs-batch**; no one-off edit.
- **(PARTIALLY RESOLVED 2026-07-04)** Windows triage: w9-3 fixed the
  Linux daemon-spawn flakiness; windows-latest CI pending a push.
  NOTE 2026-07-12: the macOS `blit_utils` residual (pre-existing,
  reproduced at `6d37a22`) ran ELEVATED under heavy load (~3/12 vs 2/8
  historical) — own finding if it persists on a quiet machine.
- *(Resolved 2026-07-12/13: SizeMtime SKIP, `725aa07`, the `./NAME` foot-gun,
  otp-5b-3 cancel, the change-journal premise — all landed; see DEVLOG.)*

## Handoff log (newest first, keep ≤ 3)

- **2026-07-14 (49th)** — **Mac↔Mac instrument, rounds 3–6: 48 more findings, 48
  accepted, NO DATA TAKEN; the harness REFUSES a timed run.** Four rework+review cycles,
  every one of which found a defect capable of a **false claim**, and every one of which
  found it in a *branch the previous fix had not covered*.
  **R3** (`cae2e0f`): **my timer read a 1000 ms sleep as −1 ms** (cross-process
  `monotonic()` is process-relative on macOS) — every row would have been fsync noise.
  **R4** (`a9460ce`): grok **drove a clean `VANISHES` while every control carried the
  full rig-W effect**. **R5** (`aebd50b`): **the settle had NEVER RUN, in any revision**
  — a quoting bug killed it in the very commit that added it to neutralise an artifact
  that can *manufacture* P1; and the same materiality bug escaped a **third** time.
  **R6** (`1e03063`): it escaped a **fourth** time — the marginal bar still substituted
  for paired magnitude and reported `REPRODUCES` off a **1 ms** effect; a control at
  **D=+229** certified as "clean". Rev 7's answer is structural: **the bar takes no part
  in inference**, and **the controls are a precondition for any verdict at all**.
  Guard: 27 cases, **18/18 mutations killed**, fuzz over measurand AND controls.
  Full: **DEVLOG 2026-07-14 16:30Z**.
  **Codex ran out of credits mid-session; the owner redeemed a reset, so both reviewers
  are live again.** In-flight: **the round-7 review (codex + grok) was launched and its
  results land in `.review/results/macmac-harness-r7.*` — READ THEM FIRST.**
  No rig time taken; rigs clean.
  **NEXT: adjudicate round 7 → the run → pf-1.**
- **2026-07-14 (48th)** — **pf-0 ran; MTU is KILLED as a cause of P1** (`r = −3.1%`;
  256 runs, 0 voided). codex NOT READY → **7/7 accepted** (`11f0c2a`): every *claim*
  outran the data — the run is **not powered** for a *contributing*-size effect
  (46 ms < the 78 ms floor), and declaring the frozen baseline VOID was **not an
  agent's call**. **The fast arm is BISTABLE** (the mode mixture, not MTU, sets the
  noise floor). TM on `q` fired 1 min before the run (owner disabled it; the quiet-gate
  does not catch it); a **physically flapping `en8`** killed three starts.
  Full: **DEVLOG 2026-07-14 06:20Z**.
- **2026-07-13/14 (47th)** — P1 reproduces on a second Mac (`q`); new bench Mac;
  Windows attrs+ADS bug (D-2026-07-13-3); the robocopy headline was WRONG
  (D-2026-07-13-2); MTU prereg rev 1→4. Full: **DEVLOG 2026-07-14 00:15Z**.
- *(46th and earlier pruned to the cap — see DEVLOG 2026-07-06..14.)*
