# otp12-pf1-rigw-harness — reduced paired P1 diagnostic on q ↔ Windows

**Slice**: OTP12 performance-finding pf-1, P1 rig harness only.

## What

The acceptance harness cannot be reused unchanged for the phase diagnostic.
It retains old/new and push/pull-shaped orchestration, drains Windows even
when q is the destination, keeps one daemon alive across instrumentation-state
changes, discards successful client stderr, and can create a firewall rule.
Those properties either destroy the SOURCE/DESTINATION comparison or make the
new two-endpoint trace uncorrelatable.

## Approach

- Use semantic `source_init` and `destination_init` arms. SOURCE sends and
  DESTINATION receives in both arms; the varied property is only which
  endpoint initiates the one `Transfer` session.
- Pin one canonical source tree per direction and fixture. Both roles read the
  same q or Windows physical path and land into a precreated container of the
  same depth and shape. The harness verifies the complete landed file count
  and byte sum before accepting each arm.
- Run a fixed OFF–ON–ON–OFF four-block schedule over
  `wm_tcp_mixed`, `mw_tcp_mixed`, `wm_grpc_mixed`, and `wm_tcp_large`.
  Pair rounds traverse cells forward/reverse/reverse/forward and run the two
  roles adjacently, producing eight pairs per trace state and cell with a
  four/four role-first balance (128 timed transfers).
- Stop and restart both exact daemons for every block, including ON→ON. Each
  block has a common run ID; every TCP client log supplies the 16-hex session
  fingerprint that correlates its peer daemon records. Windows logs are
  retrieved through base64 with SHA-256 verification.
- Fail closed on the exact build, route/interface/IP/MAC/MTU/link speeds,
  direction-specific negotiated MSS, firewall-rule identity, timer
  calibration, load, Time Machine, Spotlight, Windows CPU/disk drain, stale
  processes, PID ownership, port teardown, trace leakage, incomplete trace
  inventory, or landed-tree mismatch. The harness never changes firewall,
  MTU, routing, Time Machine, Spotlight, or unrelated processes.
- Use destination-keyed durability: q file fsync for Windows→q and Windows
  volume flush for q→Windows. Both client locations capture the same q
  monotonic completion anchor, take the same three after-clock samples, and
  wait only to the absolute +250 ms deadline before durability. The measured
  settle must remain in `[250,1000)` ms and is retained in `runs.csv`.
  Successful Windows client logs are retrieved only after durability and the
  current landed count/byte verification. Both caches are purged before every arm and
  Windows disk writes must drain.
- Compute paired differences `d_i = destination_init_i − source_init_i`, the
  registered split drifts, role-order drift, the full paired range that guards
  the known bimodal fast arm, trace observer bias, and conservative
  `N_resolution`. Reports retain every sorted arm/difference distribution and
  use only per-endpoint monotonic clocks for phase intervals. Cross-host clock
  samples quantify uncertainty and are never silently subtracted.

## Files

- `scripts/bench_otp12pf_rigw.sh` — q-side registered runner and endpoint
  gates.
- `scripts/otp12pf_rigw_analyze.py` — exact schedule, trace, clock, phase, and
  resolution validator/reporter.
- `scripts/otp12pf_rigw_analyze_test.py` — complete synthetic session and
  fail-closed mutations.
- `.agents/machines.md` — current direction-specific MSS and q SSH endpoint
  fact.

## Tests

- `SELFTEST=1 bash scripts/bench_otp12pf_rigw.sh` proves the exact block/arm
  inventory and canonical path construction without contacting either rig
  endpoint.
- `python3 scripts/otp12pf_rigw_analyze_test.py` builds complete synthetic
  evidence (128 arms, 768 clock samples, split client/daemon phase logs) and
  rejects missing clock rows, missing endpoint trace, trace-off leakage,
  gRPC trace leakage, schedule drift, sequence gaps, and terminal/inventory
  corruption. It pins the split/range/role-order/observer resolution math and
  all exported reports.
- The same self-test runs under q's actual macOS Bash and Python so Bash 3.2
  and platform behavior are exercised, not inferred from nagatha.
- Mutation proof: removing role-order drift and the full paired-range term from
  `N_pair` makes the synthetic diagnostic fail (`N_resolution` falls from 70
  ms to 40 ms); restoring them returns the analyzer suite to green.
- Mutation proof: excluding successful client logs from trace discovery makes
  the synthetic diagnostic fail on a missing SOURCE/DESTINATION endpoint;
  restoring both client and daemon evidence roots returns all tests to green.
- Mutation proof: reducing the clock-row formatter from 12 fields to 11 makes
  the harness self-test fail before analysis; restoring the exact 12-column
  schema returns the local and q/macOS self-tests to green.
- The analyzer rejects a missing `settled_ms` column, non-integer values, and
  values outside `[250,1000)`. Synthetic evidence supplies the lower valid
  bound so every accepted arm proves the registered settle window.
- The analyzer parses each timing component once, requires exact Decimal
  `total_ms = transfer_ms + flush_ms`, and uses that durable total for every
  paired median, delta, distribution, observer-bias, and resolution-floor
  value. The fixed settle window remains excluded. Corrupt totals are rejected;
  role-specific flush mutations prove the summaries cannot fall back to the
  pre-durability transfer time.
- Mutation proof: replacing the absolute-deadline wait with a no-op makes the
  harness self-test fail because it returns before +250 ms. Moving the
  successful Windows client-log fetch ahead of the durability marker makes
  the production-order self-test fail. Restoring both returns the harness and
  analyzer self-tests to green.
- Every trace-on TCP session must prove the complete seven-epoch one-stream
  ramp from one to eight live sockets on both roles, including exact proposal,
  preparation, ACK, settlement, attachment, and role-local ordering evidence.
  Removing epoch 7 makes the targeted analyzer guard fail; disabling exact
  target/live validation makes all four final-epoch SOURCE and DESTINATION
  mutations fail. Restoring both guards returns the analyzer suite to green.
- The build-identity self-test accepts the exact 12-character clean marker and
  mutation-proves that the same marker with `.dirty` is rejected. Live q and
  Windows gates apply that positive-and-negative check to both binaries.
- The repository gate is green: `cargo fmt --all -- --check`,
  `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`,
  `cargo test --workspace`, the documentation gate, analyzer tests, and shell
  syntax checks all passed.

## Known gaps

- The independent harness audit found open fail-closed gaps in phase causal
  ordering and landed relative-path identity. It also
  found that failure cleanup can discard the
  current Windows logs or leave a completion marker before cleanup succeeds,
  the Windows launcher PID is not identity-checked before termination, and a
  reused output directory can retain stale terminal markers. No live datum is
  valid until each gap is fixed and reviewed.
- No rig datum is produced by this slice. The full live run waits for the
  committed harness, mandatory Codex adjudication, exact isolated builds, and
  a green endpoint preflight.
- This four-cell run is the reduced P1 phase diagnostic, not the entire pf-1
  hard gate. The active plan still requires the separately reviewed
  small-fixture/P2 work, phase report, and `0f922de` historical control before
  pf-1 closes.
- q was not quiet during the first read-only readiness sample on 2026-07-15:
  Time Machine AutoBackup was enabled and Spotlight was using substantial CPU.
  The harness reports and refuses those conditions; it does not mutate them.

## Reviewer comments

Pending mandatory Codex review after commit.
