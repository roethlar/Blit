//! Local→local transfer: the one app-layer chokepoint (CLI + TUI).
//!
//! Since otp-11 this rides the unified `TransferSession` over the
//! in-process transport (`crate::transfer_session::run_local_session`,
//! `docs/plan/OTP11_LOCAL_SESSION.md`): both roles in this process, the
//! same choreography as every remote session, bytes applied through the
//! local write strategy (clonefile / block-clone / copy_file_range where
//! available). The signature is unchanged — callers keep building
//! `LocalMirrorOptions` and consuming `LocalMirrorSummary`.
//!
//! The CLI's `build_local_options` still reads `TransferArgs`
//! directly, so this function accepts the already-built
//! `LocalMirrorOptions` struct from blit-core; the TUI builds its own
//! `LocalMirrorOptions` from its Verify form — same shape, no clap
//! coupling.
